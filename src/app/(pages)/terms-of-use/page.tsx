      <h2>1. Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services are NOT offered to persons or entities who reside in, are
        citizens of, are incorporated in, or have a registered office in the
        United States of America or any Prohibited Localities, namely Restricted
        Persons, as defined below. We do not make exceptions. If you are a
        Restricted Person, then do not attempt to access or use the services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of a virtual private network (e.g., a VPN) or other means by
        Restricted Persons to access or use the services is prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all other nationality users, the information provided when using the
        services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
        entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use
        would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
        registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
      </p>

      <h3>Products and Features</h3>
      <p>
        The Interface allows users to manage gas (<strong>Gas Fees</strong>)
        when they interact with different Blockchains and offers access to
        numerous liquidity sources across multiple chains.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Interface may include other products and/or features added for user
        experience development and improvement, including informational,
        security, and entertainment purposes. These are not intended to affect
        the main purpose of the Interface described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only provide you with access to the relevant interface and software
        and neither control your interactions with the blockchain nor encourage
        you to perform any. Any interaction performed by you via the Interface
        remains your sole responsibility.
      </p>
      <h2>Gas Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to the
        appropriate network (<strong>"Gas Fees"</strong>). Except as otherwise
        expressly set forth in the terms of another offer by UniLend LTD, you
        will be solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees for any transaction that
        you initiate via any of our Services.
      </p>

      <h2>Blockchain Networks Transactions</h2>
      <p>
        In order to be completed, all transactions with cryptocurrency, digital
        tokens, or digital assets (<strong>"virtual currency"</strong>) must be
        confirmed and recorded in the associated public blockchain. Such
        networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by
        independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over the Blockchain Networks and, therefore, cannot
        and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via the
        Interface will be confirmed and processed. By using the Interface, you
        acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be
        completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Blockchain Networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not store, transfer, transmit, convert, broker, hold, escrow,
        mint, mine, or otherwise interact with any virtual currency, security,
        financial instrument, or other digital or physical asset. All
        interactions are performed on third-party platforms, subject to any
        associated third-party terms. Any transfer in virtual currency occurs on
        the Blockchain Network and not on a network owned by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee that we can affect the transfer of title or right in
        any virtual currency. You accept and acknowledge that we are not
        responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with
        any virtual currency transaction initiated via the Interface. We
        strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully
        before attempting to transfer a virtual currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Completion of transactions that you instruct through the Interface also
        depends on the availability and operation of the Blockchain Networks.
        Errors or forks in the Blockchain Networks may cause transactions that
        you initiate through the Interface to fail. This may mean that the
        transaction you were originally intending to perform will no longer be
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the decentralized nature of the Blockchain Networks, there is no
        single point of failure. Neither we nor any particular party will be
        responsible for errors or any losses that you suffer as a result.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Certain products accessible through the Interface, including related
        applications, may be subject to additional terms. Such additional terms
        are an integral part of these Terms of Use. However, in the event of a
        conflict, the provisions of any such special terms or other agreement
        shall prevail.
      </p>
