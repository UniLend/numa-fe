      <h3>1. Our Services</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Our Services are NOT offered to persons or entities who reside in, are
          citizens of, are incorporated in, or have a registered office in the
          United States of America or any Prohibited Localities, namely
          Restricted Persons, as defined below. We do not make exceptions. If
          you are a Restricted Person, then do not attempt to access or use the
          services.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of a virtual private network (e.g., a VPN) or other means by
        Restricted Persons to access or use the services is prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all other nationality users, the information provided when using the
        services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
        entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use
        would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
        registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
      </p>
      <h3>Products and Features</h3>
      <p>
        The Interface allows users to manage gas (<strong>Gas Fees</strong>)
        when they interact with different Blockchains and offers access to
        numerous liquidity sources across multiple chains.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Interface may include other products and/or features added for user
        experience development and improvement, including informational,
        security, and entertainment purposes. These are not intended to affect
        the main purpose of the Interface described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only provide you with access to the relevant interface and software
        and neither control your interactions with the blockchain nor encourage
        you to perform any. Any interaction performed by you via the Interface
        remains your sole responsibility.
      </p>
      <h3>Gas Fees</h3>
      <p>
        Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to the
        appropriate network (<span>"Gas Fees"</span>). Except as otherwise
        expressly set forth in the terms of another offer by UniLend LTD, you
        will be solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees for any transaction that
        you initiate via any of our Services.
      </p>
      <h3>Blockchain Networks Transactions</h3>
      <p>
        In order to be completed, all transactions with cryptocurrency, digital
        tokens or digital assets (“virtual currency”) must be confirmed and
        recorded in the associated public blockchain. Such networks are
        decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third
        parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control
        over the Blockchain Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure
        that any transaction details that you submit via the Interface will be
        confirmed and processed. By using the Interface, you acknowledge and
        agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or
        may be substantially delayed, by the Blockchain Networks
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not store, transfer, transmit, convert, broker, hold, escrow,
        mint, mine, or otherwise interact with any virtual currency, security,
        financial instrument, or other digital or physical asset and all the
        interactions are performed on the third-party platforms, subject to any
        associated third-party terms. Any transfer that occurs in any virtual
        currency occurs on the Blockchain Network and not on a network owned by
        us. We therefore do not guarantee that we can affect the transfer of
        title or right in any virtual Currency. You accept and acknowledge that
        we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in
        connection with any virtual currency transaction initiated via the
        Interface. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details
        carefully before attempting to transfer a virtual currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Completion of transactions that you instruct for through the Interface
        also depends on the availability and operation of the Blockchain
        Networks. Errors or forks in the Blockchain Networks may cause
        transactions that you initiate through the Interface to fail. This may
        mean that the transaction you were originally intending to perform will
        no longer be available. Unfortunately, due to the decentralized nature
        of the Blockchain Networks, there is no one single point of failure, and
        so neither we nor any particular party will be responsible to you for
        errors or any losses that you suffer as a result.
      </p>
      <h3>Additional Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Certain products accessible through the Interface, including related
        applications, may be subject to additional terms. Such additional terms
        are an integral part of these Terms of Use. However, in the event of a
        conflict, the provisions of any such special terms or other agreement
        shall prevail.
      </p>

        waive the right to have any and all disputes or claims arising from
        these T erms, your use or access to the Interface or any other disputes
        with the UniLend LTD (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in a court; and
        (b) waive any right to a jury trial. Instead, you and the UniLend LTD
        agree to arbitrate Disputes that are not resolved informally (as
        described below) through binding arbitration (i.e. the referral of a
        Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and
        making a final and binding determination to resolve it) instead of
        having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
      </p>
      <h4>Restrictions</h4>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. T o the full extent permitted by law,
        (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
        class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
        persons.
      </p>
      <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
        (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
        validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any
        Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
        invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
        injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
        falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
        unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
        Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
      </p>
      <h4>Choice of Law</h4>
      <p>
        These T erms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the
        BVI, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern the T erms
        and any Dispute between you and us. Any Dispute under these T erms shall
        be finally settled by Binding Arbitration (as defined above). You
        further agree that the Interface shall be deemed to be based solely in
        the BVI and that, although the Interface may be available in other
        jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or
        specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the BVI.
